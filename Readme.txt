Website Readme Text
This read me file just a brief description of what my website is going to be currently my website is going to be a portfolio website that contains my artwork throughout the UAT. Below is currently what I have for links to the web page:

My profile.html
My profile.css

I am in the process of creating a web page for my art portfolio currently having issues with it we'll look up and research for help. The goal is to create one page and one CSS page I will later add my arts page and in about me or contact page.
Once I have a better understanding of the code that I'm creating for a website I will make the 2nd and 3rd page I will ask the teachers for help and assistance whether or not I meet the criteria for the final assignment.
