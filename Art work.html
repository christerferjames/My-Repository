                    <p>I was introduced to the process of unwrapping and texturing various objects. 
                        The tutorials were extremely helpful in helping me understand the purpose of each tool used to create these images. 
                        Building on my previous work from last week, I was able to add a skeleton to my character, 
                        which enabled me to give it motion and create different poses.</p></div>

                            <p>Working with Maya has proven to be both challenging and immensely rewarding.
                                 Over time, I have come to understand the software's fundamentals more thoroughly. 
                                 The images presented here showcase a weapon design. As I grew more confident in my abilities, 
                                 I created the image below, which features glow effects applied to the weapon.</p></div>

                    <!-- text that will be displayed in the box -->
                    <p>In this project, I was responsible for designing the Damned character pieces, which were intended to 
                        be mutated creatures for a tabletop board game. I utilized 3DS Max to create the models and then 
                        exported the files for 3D printing. I believe they turned out well given the tight turnaround. 
                        I look forward to spending more time refining these models in the future.</p></div>

                        <p>The following pictures showcase my attempts at wireframing a 3D model. Although it has taken me 
                            considerable time to become accustomed to the wireframe model, I found certain aspects, 
                            particularly the process of creating joints for each limb, to be relatively straightforward. 
                            As a beginner, I believe that with continued practice, I can improve my skills significantly. 
                            I recognize that studying how I and others move our bodies will greatly enhance my ability to
                             manipulate the character effectively, especially once smooth animation is applied. However, 
                             animation has been a challenging aspect of character movement for me, and I realize that I will 
                             need to pursue additional classes and conduct more research to refine this skill.</p></div>
